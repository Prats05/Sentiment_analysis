# Sentiment_analysis
AmazonFresh provides its customers with home delivery services for a variety of food items and groceries. A customer can review and rate the product he has ordered in the past. These reviews are an important characteristic from a business perspective. Reviews are the major driving force for the sales of various products since customers rely on them. For this project, we are going to perform sentimental analysis on Amazon reviews provided by the customers for a variety of fine food items. Sentiment analysis of reviews will help the company in getting information about a product through the customer’s opinion. It will also help in automating the business process. We propose to find out which type of food products are reviewed the most, which words decide whether a review is positive or negative. We will also discuss how this technique will help create business value.

<b>Project Scope</b>
The project will provide the following deliverables:
 Classification of reviews into positive or negative
 Prediction of score
 Identify the most reviewed product
 Find correlation/association between features and target attribute
